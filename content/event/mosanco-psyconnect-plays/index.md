Ever since the pandemic started, we have been hosting our “PsyConnect Plays!” on Zoom. Fortunately, with the recent loosening of Covid-19 measures, we were finally able to hold our first ever board games edition of “PsyConnect Plays!” on-site at Settler’s cafe on the 19th December 2021.

Of course, with the Covid-19 protocols in place so as to ensure the safety of everyone even as we have fun! What a jolly way to start this Christmas season with many new faces and exchanges of laughter!
